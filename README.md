# Morse Code Project
## Project Summary and Problem Solved
In my Morse code project, I programmed an LED to blink in Morse code to signal "SOS" continuously, with a button input that toggles between "SOS" and "OK" messages. This project addressed the challenge of creating an interactive, real-time visual signal system that could be useful in emergency scenarios where quick visual communication is needed.

## What I Did Well
I was able to structure the code to handle both the continuous "SOS" output and switch smoothly between patterns based on user input. Setting up a reliable toggle mechanism showed my ability to create responsive, interactive control logic, and I’m proud of how reliably it works.

## Where I Could Improve
Looking back, I could improve this project by adding more error handling to make it even more reliable, especially if I expand it further. Additionally, breaking the code into more modular functions for each pattern could help make it easier to read and enhance its adaptability.

## Tools and Resources I’m Adding to My Support Network
To support this type of work, I’m looking into resources like circuit schematics, microcontroller libraries, and community forums such as Stack Overflow. These resources are great for troubleshooting and learning new techniques, which will strengthen my future projects.

## Transferable Skills
From this project, I’ve developed skills in hardware programming, LED control, and handling user input to change states in real-time. These skills are highly transferable and will be valuable for future projects in embedded systems, IoT, or even automation tasks.

## How I Made the Project Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable
I kept the code maintainable by organizing it to separate the different Morse code patterns and toggle logic, which improved readability. Adding clear comments and using modular functions also made the project adaptable for future enhancements.

# Thermostat Project
## Project Summary and Problem Solved
In my thermostat project, I created a system to monitor button inputs, check temperature, and control an LED heater while sending data to a server via UART communication. This project tackled the need for a simple automated system capable of temperature control and real-time reporting—something useful for embedded systems or environmental controls.

## What I Did Well
I’m particularly proud of how I implemented the task scheduler to handle multiple functions, like monitoring buttons and controlling temperature in real-time. The UART communication aspect also went smoothly, and I feel it added a strong dimension of real-time data reporting to the project.

## Where I Could Improve
To make the project even better, I could focus on optimizing the task scheduler to handle inputs and data faster, reducing latency in multiple simultaneous operations. Breaking down the tasks into smaller, well-documented functions would also improve modularity, making the system easier to expand.

## Tools and Resources I’m Adding to My Support Network
For this type of work, I’m adding tools like oscilloscope analysis, documentation on UART protocols, and other embedded systems resources to my toolkit. These will support debugging and optimization efforts and deepen my understanding of embedded design principles.

## Transferable Skills
Through this project, I strengthened my abilities in task scheduling, real-time data handling, and UART communication—all skills that will be valuable for networking and systems integration projects in the future.

## How I Made the Project Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable
I kept the code maintainable by following a structured commenting style and organizing the code into clear sections. Making tasks logically segmented allowed me to ensure that the code is readable and easy to modify, making it adaptable to future changes or additional features.
